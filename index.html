        <em>Speedrunner and Board Game Designer</em>
      </p>
      <p>I am a human who enjoys making and playing games.
        My focus when playing games is learning how the rules and mechanics interact to try to find optimal strategies but when I'm designing a game I tend to focus more on the fun.
        A game I codesigned was a selected finalist and won the Kublacon Game Design Competition and was signed to Tasty Minstrel Games to be released soon.
        I stream my speedruns on Twitch and have participated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_PrWkGLWqo">two online marathons</a>
        and provided commentary at <a href="https://youtu.be/4pejFW9W_yM">two Games Done Quick events</a>.</p></td>
